Our solution will make exercise more fun, by combining fitness and gaming. 
Basically, we make games that require players to do physical movements to control the game instead of pressing buttons. 
We use the pygame library to develop the game, use Mediapipe and OpenCV to develop the pose detection model that allows detecting user actions.
